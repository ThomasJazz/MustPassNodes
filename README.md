# Must Pass Nodes
## Problem
You are given a graph and two vertices `s` and `t`. Implement a linear time algorithm that finds all the vertices `u` such that all shortest paths from `s` to `t` pass through `u`.
## Implementation
* Class `Lab3` contains the three function `problem`. Implement solutions in this function.
* Do _NOT_ make changes outside these functions.
* `Graph` class contains `BFS` and `DFS` functions. Use `BFS`.
* Implement in _linear_ run time
